# Robot Dynamics 

This is a repository that explores robot dynamics by exploiting the wonders of Lie algebra to <br>
perform some of the very fundamental algorithms in robotics.

For now I will implement the very basics of robot dynamics with a framework to describe kinematics constraits that is 
<br> easy and intuitive
